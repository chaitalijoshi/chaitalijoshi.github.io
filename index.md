## Research Interests
I am a quantum physcist interested in building scalable devices for the next generation of quantum networks and computers. Currently, I work with superconducting circuits, developing new devices for hybrid quantum networks. During my PhD, I worked on quantum nonlinear photonics, developing deterministic single-photon sources and tools for time-frequency manipulation of light in the quantum regime. Below, you can find publications from some of my projects.
